An Android app recording your everyday costs

This is simply the product of an Android exercise.

The point that makes the app different is the horizontal navigation model implemented with the VIewPager control. It allows users to navigate between days or weeks by simply swiping left and right. Other features of the app include multi-currency support (rate updated from a third-party service), category, remarks, simple calculator, daily notification and weekly statistics.
